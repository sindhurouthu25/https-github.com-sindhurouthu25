## 📝 About Me

Hello everyone, I’m Sindhu, currently pursuing my B.Tech 3rd year in Computer Science and Engineering with a strong passion for programming and developing new technology in full stack. Currently, I am working as an Angular Full Stack Intern at Infosys Springboard (Virtual Internship 6.0), and I was also a Mentee at Infosys Springboard – Pragati: Path to Future (Cohort 5). I have completed a Cybersecurity Virtual Internship under AICTE – IBM SkillsBuild and Edunet Foundation with a project on steganography using Python and OpenCV. I am an enthusiastic learner, especially excited to learn frontend technologies and create interactive solutions that connect with the real world. My goal is to become a software developer, and I’m actively building my skills. In my free time, I enjoy music and browsing the internet to learn new things. Let’s connect! ✨
